2 ounces of tequila of your choice, reposado or anejo is preferred
1/2 ounce of grenadine if you would like some color, poured over the back of a spoon

Mix the orange juice and tequila together, add the ice if you want it colder, then pour the grenadine over the back of a spoon to layer it.

This drink will have you saying good morning to relaxation.
