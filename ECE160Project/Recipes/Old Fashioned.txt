2 teaspoons simple syrup
1 teaspoon of cold water
2 dashes of bitters
1 large ice cube
1 and a half fluid ounces of bourbon whiskey

Garnish with a slice of an orange and a cherry if you want to give it more color. For best results, lightly smoke the cocktail for 10 seconds.

Mix well and experience the high society feeling of this classic drink.
