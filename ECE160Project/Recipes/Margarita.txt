1 wedge lime
1 teaspoon coarse sea salt
1 large ice cube
2 fluid ounces of tequila of your choice
1/2 fluid ounce triple sec
1 fluid ounce freshly squeezed lime juice
A good size slice of lime

Mix ingredients together in a shaker or pint glass, stir well, and enjoy a nice refreshing margarita.

The greatest thing about margaritas is they go with everything, but it unlocks your tastebuds if you drink one with some al pastor tacos.
